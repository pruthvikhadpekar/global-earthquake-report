# global-earthquake-report
The project effectively achieved the visualization and classification of global earthquake data collected over a ten-year period. Through the application of clustering techniques, the analysis successfully identified and highlighted regions with heightened seismic activity and associated risks. Notably, countries such as Japan and Indonesia emerged as prominent high-risk zones due to their frequent and intense earthquake occurrences. This data-driven approach not only enhances the understanding of global seismic patterns but also supports better preparedness and mitigation strategies in vulnerableÂ regions.
